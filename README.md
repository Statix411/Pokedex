### Pokedex
This is simple *pokedex app* that allows you to see most important information about almost any pokemon in one place. Just click on your's favourite pokemons name in the list on left side of the screen. If you don't see desired name in left column - just start typing pokemon name in search field to find him or use navigation buttons. Also you can set pockemons type to make searching more convinient.

You can test it by following this [Link](https://statix411.github.io/Pokedex/).

(At least I trited to do it, but I was faced with [bug]( https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/1967) ang got stuck).
